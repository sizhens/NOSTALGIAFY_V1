Input -> Type in your age
Year -> 2025 (or whatever year it is)
Target age -> 12-15
Formula:
age_difference = {current_age} - {prime_age}
Example: 28 - 12 = 16, therefore the age difference is 16 and we are looking for music from 16 years ago

target_year_start = current_year - age_difference
So, 2025 - 16 = 2009 in this context
target_year_end = target_year_start + 3
